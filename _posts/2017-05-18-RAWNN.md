After seeing the excellent [Cosmic Trigger play](https://cosmictriggerplay.com) on Friday and thinking I might use [Robert Anton Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson)'s approaches as a framework for [making art about machine learning](http://art.peteashton.com/instructions-for-humans/), I thought it apposite to push RAW's words through a neural network and see what came out the other side. I used the [torch-rnn Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/crisbal/torch-rnn/) and trained it on the [Illuminatus!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Illuminatus!_Trilogy) and [Schrödinger's Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrödinger%27s_Cat_Trilogy) trilogies along with some other books I could extract plain text from. I then recorded my Mac's speech tool reading it out over eight hours.

In other words, exactly the same process I used for the [Goodbye Wittgenstein](http://art.peteashton.com/goodbye-wittgenstein/) book and audio. Now there's a pair, which is nice. If I continue and it becomes a series maybe I'll think about doing something more with it.

R(AW)NN exists in a number of formats:
