My name is [Pete Ashton](http://peteashton.com). I used to blog a lot, in fact my first post was in June 2000. I stopped for a while and deleted everything (don't worry, I have a backup... somewhere...) but the voices in my head got too crazy so now I'm blogging again to try and quell them. 

More prosiacally, I find squeezing ideas and thoughts into sentences that might make sense to strangers a good way of figuring things out. 

[Some of those things become art](http://art.peteashton.com). Some just get me through the day. 

[I also run a newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/peteashton) which I send out weekly / fortnightly / monthly depending on the need. It gets archived here when appropriate.
