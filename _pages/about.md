Minimal Mistakes is a flexible two-column Jekyll theme. Perfect for hosting your personal site, blog, or portfolio on GitHub or self-hosting on your own server. As the name implies --- styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.

{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery" caption="Examples of included layouts `splash`, `single`, and `archive`." %}

[Install the Theme]({{ "/docs/quick-start-guide/" | relative_url }}){: .btn .btn--success .btn--large}

My name is [Pete Ashton](http://peteashton.com). I used to blog a lot. I stopped for a while but the voices in my head got too crazy so now I'm blogging again to try and quell them. 

More prosiacally, I find squeezing ideas and thoughts into sentences that might make sense to strangers a good way of figuring things out. 

[Some of those things become art](http://art.peteashton.com). Some just get me through the day.
