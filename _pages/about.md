My name is [Pete Ashton](http://peteashton.com). I used to blog a lot. I stopped for a while but the voices in my head got too crazy so now I'm blogging again to try and quell them. 

More prosiacally, I find squeezing ideas and thoughts into sentences that might make sense to strangers a good way of figuring things out. 

[Some of those things become art](http://art.peteashton.com). Some just get me through the day.
